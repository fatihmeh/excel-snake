# Excel-Snake


You play this old school snake game in Excel with buttons on a custom ribbon tab named 'SNAKE'. It takes shape as methods in the code color the cells. When snake eats random generated baits, it will grow longer. You can find the flowchart that shows code functions and their connections below.


To do:
- Add control for self collision
- Prevent snake to turn on itself
- Add control for generated baits location and snake position
- Add scoreboard
